We are students of the Masai School. Currently, we are all in unit 5. In the Masai School, at the end of every unit, the last week is called construct week. In which every student of Masai School has to build a project.

On 26th September, we got the name of the members and the project. We have to build the clone of the toggl track.com site. It is the most popular time tracking web site.

## Introduce my teammates.
1. Siddikkhan Pathan.

We had a week to build the project.

We use HTML, CSS , React-JS, Redux, Express, MongoDB, Chakra-ui and some bit of Bootstrap to build the project.

## Landing Page.

This is the landing page of the our clone site exactly the same as the Toggl track.com site. We tried to give some functionally such as Hover effects, onclick open model, calculate time you spent on our website and sign-up etc.

On the landing page, we create a navbar and search bar. If the user clicks on the menu it will show the pages of the section.

## Login Page.
